# CSV to Excel Converter

In this project I have used python to convert CSV(comma separated values) files to Excel files(".xlsx" extension).

I have mainly used pandas and tkinter library to achieve this.
Pandas is useful for reading and handling tabular data while Tkinter can be used to create user friendly GUI.

## Some snaps

__*Upload CSV File*__ button is used to select the desired CSV file which is to be converted.
__*Save as*__ button is used to select the desired location and name for output Excel file.
